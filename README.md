# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This website is a showcase of my work and skills in UI/UX design and web development. I designed the layout and user experience in Figma before translating it into a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website contains several pages, each focusing on different aspects of the services I offer, as well as information about my company and its processes.

- **Clear Service Structure**: The website features a well-organized structure where visitors can quickly navigate between different service offerings, company details, and case studies.

- **User Engagement**: Features like service cards that expand to reveal more details ensure an engaging experience that invites users to explore the services and company more deeply.

- **Professional Aesthetic**: The design maintains a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic, focusing on clear typography, simple navigation, and balanced visuals.
