# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This website is a showcase of my work and skills in UI/UX design and web development. I designed the layout and user experience in Figma before translating it into a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website contains several pages, each focusing on different aspects of the services I offer, as well as information about my company and its processes.
